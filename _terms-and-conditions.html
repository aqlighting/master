            <p class="paragraph">All prices and specifications subject to change without notice. We cannot be held responsible and do not have to honor any error, discrepancy or type error, misspelling, or omission located anywhere on our website. We are not responsible for any
              items that may not be approved by any local or state laws. This applies to any location in the world. Shipping dates or in stock postings, will always depend on the current stock status the time of day which the order is placed and our work
              load. All orders ship regular ground service unless you request a faster delivery and you have paid for this faster delivery. &nbsp;Out of stock orders will ship as soon as possible, though this may take up to 4 weeks. Customer will be charged
              the same day order is placed for in stock and out of stock items. We reserve the right to ask for wire transfer or money order on certain size orders. Not responsible for maximum or ‘max’ wattage posted. Hour life ratings posted on our web site
              and or catalogs are only a calculated average that was provided by the manufacturer and we&nbsp;DO NOTwarranty light bulbs and we do not warranty/endorse life ratings.<span class="italic"></span>

            <h4 class="tabs-images-title">Shipping</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">The travel map provided is to show approximate travel times that only apply after your order leaves our warehouse. This is not when you will actually receive your order. Any rush orders must be placed on the telephone, as our shopping cart does
              not accommodate this special request.
              <br><span class="important">Important note:<br></span>We try our best to ship orders as soon as possible. Items noted as in stock or parts in stock—made per order or with any other type of posted delivery time does not mean the item will ship the
              same day you place it. We still need to process your order. Process meaning we need to download your order, re-enter it in our system, charge it, produce the product if applicable, run it through the quality control department and finally have
              it placed in our shipping department for its turn to be packed and shipped. Please keep in mind that we are closed for shipping on Fridays and weekends so this entire processing procedure for orders placed Wednesdays or after will not begin
              until at least the following Monday or Tuesday. Again, this applies to all our items whether they have a notation of ‘in stock’ or with any posted delivery time. If you need your order processed sooner and or to ship with special travel time
              (ie. Overnight, 2-day delivery) then we highly suggest that you place it over the telephone at&nbsp;<span class="red">1-(800)-865-7221</span>&nbsp;Please be aware that shipping charges are estimated and do not take into account multiple, oversized
              packages or shipping insurance. AQL is only able to estimate shipping costs with the software UPS provides. Actual shipping charges will be calculated and added when your order is processed. If there is a significant increase in shipping, your
              order will be held and you will be contacted. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.
              <br>Sometimes with internet shopping, the cart could fail to properly calculate shipping cost and your shipping amount may not be reflected in your online shipping cart receipt, we will calculate it manually and contact you with the shipping cost.
              There are many reasons why shipping cost failed to be added to your cart that are beyond our control; This may be due to the service you selected being unavailable for your location, formatting issues, malformed zip/postal codes, items weighing
              more than 150 lbs or orders that require multiple packages due to size, etc...</p>
            <h4 class="tabs-images-title">Delivery Timing</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">If you require products delivered by a certain date, please call Customer Service at 1-800-865-7221 to verify your product availability. We have expedited options available but for expedited orders must be received by 3pm PST on Thursday as we
              are closed for shipping on Fridays and weekends. If an order is placed after 3pm PST on Thursday, the order might not be processed until the next Monday (unless it's a holiday). AQL's goal is to ship orders within 1-10 business days. If the
              items you ordered require assembly (such as gooseneck light fixtures), allow 1-20 days to ship (depending on the availability of materials). Affordable Quality Lighting is unable to guarantee at any time a certain delivery date or time frame
              for delivery for any product on order. For orders with hard deadlines, please place your order well in advance of that date so we may ensure that your products arrive on time. All shipping dates are estimates, not guaranteed arrival dates. Affordable
              Quality Lighting is not responsible for lost, misplaced, or delayed shipments or damaged freight by shipping carriers.
              <br><span class="important">Special note 1:<br></span>If you have an ‘in stock’ item and also a ‘made per order’ item on the same order, the order may take longer to process based upon the time needed to make your ‘made per order’ item. Therefore
              your ‘in stock’ item will be shipped at the same time as your ‘made per order’ item.
              <br><span class="important">Special note 2:</span>
              <br>If you have an ‘in stock’ item but you choose the injecta-seal feature, the order may take a little longer to process based upon the fact that injecta-seal requires at least one day to apply and dry. It’s worth the wait!
              <br><span class="important">Special note 3:</span>
              <br>Most outdoor fixtures with a notation of parts in stock—made per order can take anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks to ship. Ship meaning after your order leaves our warehouse. This is not when you will actually receive your order, please allow for travel
              time. Any rush orders must be placed on the telephone as our shopping cart does not accommodate this special request. We are not responsible for any orders or packages not signed for or left at your door. Orders must be placed on the telephone

              2nd day, 3rd day), any back-ordered items on the order will ship UPS Ground.</p>
