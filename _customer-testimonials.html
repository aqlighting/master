								<p class='paragraph'>Thanks to Affordable Quality Lighting, the Make-A-Wish Foundation of San Diego's Gala Event was a huge hit. &nbsp;We usually hold this black tie affair at one of the hotels in San Diego. &nbsp;However, this year we descided to "lighten up" and create a fun atmosphere. &nbsp;So we rented the San Diego Aerospace Museum for the evening of October 22, 2005. &nbsp;Our theme "Where Wishes Take Flight" had the entire occassion based on airport and airline experiences. &nbsp;The entry tickets were printed to look like boarding passes, and small bags of peanuts and miniature pillows were given to everyone. &nbsp;Our unique entry was designed to look like a landing strip at an airport. &nbsp;Sid's Carpet Barn donated 60 feet of black carpet for the runway, and with addition of lighting on either side donated by Affordable Quality Lighting, the tempo for a fun and exciting night had been set. &nbsp;This annual fundraiser helps generate the necessary dollars needed to pay for the 160+ wishes we will grant this year. &nbsp;It is only made possible through the generousity of fine companies such as yours. &nbsp;Our sincere thanks, for your donation of lighting that made this event a smashing success.</p>

								<p class='paragraph'>To whom it may concern, &nbsp;I needed to replace soem outdoor lights in the front of my residence in Saratoga, California. &nbsp;The existing lights were 120 volt and I wished to replace them with the same type of light fixture. &nbsp;After many trips to Home Depot and Lowes, I found very little to offer in design and the 120 volt type fixture. &nbsp;The quality of the fixtures they did have was very disappointing. &nbsp;I then went to specialty light stores who had catalogs of lights I could order but I was shocked at the steep cost. &nbsp;I descided to search the Internet and I found Affordable Quality Lighting. &nbsp;At the website, I found a large choice of lights, many of which could be ordered in 12v or 120v. &nbsp;The prices were very reasonable. &nbsp;I settled on the Large Top Pagoda Area light and ordered five fixtures a few days before Christmas. &nbsp;The lights were shipped &nbsp;on the day I ordered them and arrived just a few days after the holiday. &nbsp;My wife and I were very pleased with the product we received and their quality. &nbsp;We would use Affordable Quality [Lighting] again for our lighting needs. &nbsp;</p>

								<p class='paragraph'>Dear Tom: I have not had the 120v lights installed yet. &nbsp;The electrician will be starting next week. &nbsp;But as for the light fixtures themselves, I think they are very good. &nbsp;The quality seems solid and the powder coating is very even and consistant. &nbsp;I do like the glass globe much better than anything I have seen that is plastic or plexiglass. &nbsp;I have assembled the low voltage lights and laid them out next to the sidewalk to get the spacing the way we like. &nbsp;I will finish their installation this weekend but they are much, much better than any of the other low voltage lights found at the local home builder stores. &nbsp;Again, the frosted glass globe is very superior to the plastic found on other products. &nbsp;Thank you for your excellent survive and selling a quality product for such a reasonable price.</p>

								<p>The under cabinet low voltage puck lights really did the job for us. &nbsp;They really make our granite counters shine. &nbsp;I am sure that over cabinet low voltage rope lighting will do the same for the copper ceiling we installing in our 1873 kitchen. &nbsp;Thanks for great pre- and post- sale support, as well as great products.</p>
